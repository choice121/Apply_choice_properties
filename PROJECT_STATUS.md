## Phase 1 — Critical: Security & Legal

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Priority:** Highest — legal and security exposure

### Objectives
- Remove hardcoded admin credentials from source code
- Add management countersignature to executed lease
- Fix Lead Paint Disclosure legal language
- Fix month-to-month lease end date calculation
- Add lease generation validation (prevent $0 rent leases)

### Tasks

- [x] **1.1** Remove hardcoded credentials from `setupAdminPassword()` in `backend/code.gs`
- [x] **1.2** Add management countersignature system to lease (new columns + GAS function + admin panel button + signature block in lease document + pending notice on confirmation page)
- [x] **1.3** Fix Lead Paint Disclosure clause (remove false "acknowledges receipt" language)
- [x] **1.4** Fix month-to-month lease end date: display "Month-to-Month — No Fixed Expiration" instead of calculated +1 month date
- [x] **1.5** Add server-side validation to `generateAndSendLease()` — reject if `monthlyRent` ≤ 0 or `leaseStartDate` is empty

### Files to Modify
- `backend/code.gs`

### Expected Outcome
- No credentials in source code
- Executed lease is legally complete (both parties represented)
- Lead Paint clause does not make false statements
- Month-to-month leases show accurate term
- Lease cannot be sent with missing financial data

### Verification Checklist

- [x] `grep -n "choiceproperties404" backend/code.gs` returns no results ✓
- [x] `AUDIT_REPORT.md` no longer contains plaintext credentials — redacted with fix note ✓
- [x] Lease document contains a management signature block ✓
- [x] Month-to-month lease end date shows "Month-to-Month — No Fixed Expiration" ✓
- [x] `generateAndSendLease()` returns an error if rent = 0 ✓

- [x] **6.2** Add "Mark as Refunded" admin action and "refunded" payment status
- [x] **6.3** Add deadline field to the Request Holding Fee modal — include deadline in holding fee request email
- [x] **6.4** Enhance payment confirmation email with a formatted receipt block (amount, date, method, reference)

### Files Modified
- `backend/code.gs` (admin panel HTML + GAS functions)

---

## Phase 7 — GAS Automation (Triggers)

**Status:** CANCELLED
**Decision:** All emails and status updates are handled manually by admin through the dashboard. No automated triggers will be implemented. Email templates created in Phase 4 (`leaseSigningReminder`, `leaseExpiryAdminAlert`) remain in the codebase as dispatch functions the admin can call manually if needed, but no time-based GAS triggers will be installed.

---

## Phase 8 — UX & Flow Completion

**Status:** COMPLETE — April 7, 2026

### Objectives
- Improve applicant dashboard denied state ✓
- Add document upload UI to the form ✓
- Add "Mark as Contacted" admin action ✓
- Add application age indicator to admin panel ✓
- Add "Withdraw Application" flow on dashboard ✓

### Tasks

- [x] **8.1** Denied dashboard: added "Reapplication Protection" card — shows 30-day no-fee window, 60-day results validity, and contact CTAs (phone + email buttons)
- [x] **8.2** Document upload: added dropzone UI in Step 6 (PDF/JPG/PNG, 4 MB/file, up to 4 files); JS encodes files to base64 on submit; GAS saves to `CP_Applicant_Docs` Drive folder and writes URLs to new `Document URLs` sheet column
- [x] **8.3** Mark as Contacted: added `markAsContacted()` GAS function; new `Last Contacted` sheet column; "Mark Contacted" button added to both admin card renderers (server-rendered and client-side); "Contacted" green badge shown on card when set
- [x] **8.4** Application age: both admin card renderers now show "Xd old" chip on every card — turns amber after 14 days
- [x] **8.5** Withdraw Application: added `withdrawApplication()` GAS function; "Withdraw my application" link on dashboard (hidden for approved/denied/signed); dashboard handles 'withdrawn' status state; property reverts to 'active' on withdrawal

### Files Modified
- `backend/code.gs` — 8 function additions/changes + both card renderers + dashboard template
- `index.html` — document upload section in Step 6
- `css/style.css` — upload zone styles
- `js/script.js` — `setupFileUploads()`, base64 submit encoding

---

## Completed Tasks Log

### Phase 8 — April 7, 2026
- **8.1** Added "Reapplication Protection" card to denied applicant dashboard: 30-day no-fee reapplication window, 60-day results validity, phone + email CTAs.
- **8.2** Added drag-and-drop document upload zone to Step 6 (PDF/JPG/PNG, 4 MB max/file, up to 4 files). JS encodes files to base64 on form submit. GAS `processApplication()` saves files to `CP_Applicant_Docs` Drive folder and stores public URLs in new `Document URLs` sheet column. Upload zone added to `index.html`; CSS in `css/style.css`; `setupFileUploads()` implemented in `js/script.js`.
- **8.3** Added `markAsContacted()` GAS function; new `Last Contacted` sheet column; "Mark Contacted" button in both admin card renderers; "Contacted" green badge shown when date is set.
- **8.4** Application age chip ("Xd old") added to both admin card renderers (client-side + server-rendered). Chip turns amber after 14 days.
- **8.5** Added `withdrawApplication()` GAS function; "Withdraw my application" link on applicant dashboard; `withdrawn` status state; property reverts to `active` on withdrawal.

### Phase 5 — April 7, 2026
- **5.1** Added `@media print` CSS to `renderLeaseConfirmPage()` — hides buttons and contact info, keeps card, detail box, and next-steps sections. Updated button label to "Save or Print Your Lease (PDF)" and added browser-print instruction text below the buttons.
- **5.2** Added "Property Address (verify and correct before sending)" text field to the Send Lease modal (`leasePropertyAddress`). `showLeaseModal()` now accepts a 5th `propertyAddress` param and pre-fills the field. Both card builder call sites (client-side JS template and server-rendered GAS) updated to pass the property address via `safeAddr`. `submitLease()` collects it and passes it as `verifiedPropertyAddress` to `generateAndSendLease()`. GAS function stores it in the new `Verified Property Address` sheet column. `renderLeaseSigningPage()` prefers `Verified Property Address` over `Property Address` when rendering the lease document.
- **5.3** Removed all Pet Addendum cross-references from Clause 4. Pet-present variant now reads "Pet terms are agreed in writing with Management prior to move-in and are incorporated into this Agreement." No-pets variant no longer references "execution of a Pet Addendum."
- **5.4** Updated Clause 13 from "strongly encouraged" to "required," with added proof-of-coverage language. Added 5th confirmation checkbox `agreeInsurance` (row5) to the lease signing page. `validateSignatureForm()` updated to require all 5 checkboxes. Hint text updated from "4 checkboxes" to "5 checkboxes." `submitSignature()` now collects the insurance flag and passes it as the 4th argument to `signLease()`. `signLease()` backend updated to store "Yes"/"No" in new `Renter Insurance Agreed` sheet column. Both columns added to `addMissingLeaseColumns()`.
- **5.5** Verified already correctly implemented in previous session. Early termination Clause 15 conditionally uses `jur.mtmNoticeDays` for month-to-month tenancies and `jur.earlyTermNoticeDays` for fixed-term leases. No code change needed.
- **5.6** Added "View your executed lease agreement" link and descriptive note to `EmailTemplates.leaseSignedTenant` template. Lease URL derived from `dashboardLink` by replacing `path=dashboard` with `path=lease`.

### Phase 4 — April 7, 2026
- **4.1** Added `EmailTemplates.holdingFeeReceived` template. Added `sendHoldingFeeReceivedEmail()` dispatch function. `markHoldingFeePaid()` now calls it after updating the sheet, computing remaining move-in balance from rent + deposit − holding fee.
- **4.2** Added `EmailTemplates.leaseSigningReminder` template. Added `sendLeaseSigningReminder()` dispatch function (ready for Phase 7 trigger to call).
- **4.3** Added `EmailTemplates.leaseExpiryAdminAlert` template. Added `sendLeaseExpiryAdminAlert()` dispatch function that emails all admin addresses (ready for Phase 7 trigger to call).
- **4.4** Added `EmailTemplates.moveInPreparationGuide` template with move-in payment breakdown, what-to-bring checklist, utility setup note, renter's insurance requirement, parking reminder, and maintenance contact. Added `sendMoveInPreparationGuide()` dispatch. `signLease()` now calls it after recording the signature.
- **4.5** Added `EmailTemplates.adminReviewSummary` template with full application data table (property, applicant, residency, employment, references, background, co-applicant sections). Added `sendAdminReviewSummary(appId)` dispatch that fetches the row from the sheet.
- **4.6** Refactored `sendResumeEmail()` to use `EMAIL_BASE_CSS`, `buildEmailHeader()`, and `EMAIL_FOOTER` — now visually consistent with all other transactional emails. Content unchanged.
- **4.7** Removed `🔔` from admin notification subject; removed `🔐` from OTP email subject. Subjects now read: `New Application: [AppID] — [Name]...` and `Admin Login Code — Choice Properties`.
- **4.8** Denial email "Looking Ahead" step 1 now includes: 60-day on-file period, 30-day no-new-fee reapplication window with instruction to contact the team.
- **4.9** `markAsPaid()` now calls `sendAdminReviewSummary(appId)` immediately after `sendPaymentConfirmation()`.

### Phase 6 — April 7, 2026
- **6.1** Added `Amount Collected` field to the Mark as Paid modal (alongside the existing Payment Method dropdown and Transaction Reference field). `markAsPaid()` now accepts a 5th `amountCollected` parameter. Value is written to the new `Amount Collected` sheet column (added to `migrateSchema()`). Admin audit note also records the amount.
- **6.2** `markAsRefunded()` function confirmed complete. "Refunded" button added to the **server-rendered** admin card (`buildAdminCardHtml`) — it was already present in the client-side JS card renderer. Both paths now show the button when `Payment Status = 'paid'`.
- **6.3** Holding fee deadline dropdown confirmed complete in the Request Holding Fee modal (`requestHoldingFee()` stores deadline to `Holding Fee Deadline` sheet column; `sendHoldingFeeRequestEmail()` includes deadline in the tenant email).
- **6.4** `paymentConfirmation` email template updated to show `Amount Collected` (the actual amount the admin recorded) alongside the `Application Fee` constant. `sendPaymentConfirmation()` signature updated to pass `amountCollected` through from `markAsPaid()`.

### Phase 3 — April 7, 2026
- **3.1** Added phone digit count validation (< 10 digits → reject with clear message) and monthly income non-numeric warning (log only, never reject) in `processApplication()`.
- **3.2** Added duplicate detection before row insert: compares incoming `Email` + `Property Address` against all existing rows; skips rows with `denied` or `withdrawn` status. Returns `{ duplicate: true, existingAppId }` so the client can surface the existing reference number.
- **3.3** Extracted `generateUniqueAppId(sheet, col)` wrapper that calls `generateAppId()` up to 5 times, checking the App ID column for each candidate before returning. `processApplication()` now calls `generateUniqueAppId()` instead of `generateAppId()`.
- **3.4** `Application Fee` case in the `rowData` switch now always pushes `APPLICATION_FEE` constant — client-supplied values are completely ignored on write.
- **3.5** Added `normalizePhone(phone)` utility. Applied to 7 phone fields (`Phone`, `Co-Applicant Phone`, `Supervisor Phone`, `Reference 1 Phone`, `Reference 2 Phone`, `Emergency Phone`, `Landlord Phone`) before any sheet write.

### Phase 2 — April 7, 2026
- **2.1** Upgraded `toggleEmployerSection()` in `js/script.js` to handle 5 statuses (Employed, Self-employed, Unemployed, Retired, Student) with per-status field visibility, labels, and required enforcement. Labels re-apply on language change.
- **2.2** Added `required` to `coFirstName`, `coLastName`, `coEmail`, `coPhone` when co-applicant checkbox is checked; removes and clears them when unchecked.
- **2.3** Frontend age validation already present. Added server-side age ≥ 18 check in `processApplication()` in `backend/code.gs`.
- **2.4** Added `required` attribute and `required` CSS class to `#ref1Relationship` in `index.html`.
- **2.5** `_readApplicationFee()` now updates the fee title heading and `.fee-amount` element in the DOM when a `?fee=` URL param is present.
- **2.6** Footer Privacy Policy and Terms of Service links changed from `href="#"` to `mailto:choicepropertygroup@hotmail.com` with descriptive `title` attributes. `termsAgreeLabel` updated to honest certification wording (en + es).
- **2.7** Denial email in `backend/code.gs` now uses `"Our decision is based on our standard application review criteria."` as the fallback when no reason is provided.

### Phase 1 — April 7, 2026
- **1.1** Verified no hardcoded credentials in `setupAdminPassword()` — empty string placeholders in place
- **1.2** Added management countersignature block to the lease document HTML (before the E-SIGNATURE BLOCK in `renderLeaseSigningPage()`) and added "Management Countersignature Pending" notice to `renderLeaseConfirmPage()`. `managementCountersign()` GAS function, sheet columns, and admin panel "Countersign Lease" button were already implemented.
- **1.3** Verified Lead Paint Disclosure clause contains no "acknowledges receipt of the federal form" language — already corrected
- **1.4** Verified `calculateLeaseEndDate()` returns `null` for month-to-month and `generateAndSendLease()` displays "Month-to-Month — No Fixed Expiration" — already implemented
- **1.5** Verified `generateAndSendLease()` rejects `monthlyRent ≤ 0` and missing/invalid `leaseStartDate` — already implemented

---

## Known Issues Remaining

All 41 issues from `AUDIT_REPORT.md` have been addressed. Phases 1–6 covered the bulk of the work; Phase 8 completed the remaining UX items. Phase 7 (Automation) was cancelled by design — all communications remain admin-initiated. The system is feature-complete.

---

## Modified Files Log

### Phase 1
- `backend/code.gs` — Added management signature block in `renderLeaseSigningPage()` and countersignature pending notice in `renderLeaseConfirmPage()`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — Updated phase status to COMPLETE

---

## Verification Results

### Phase 1 — April 7, 2026
All 5 verification checks passed:
- `grep "Choice123" backend/code.gs` → 0 results ✓
- `grep "choiceproperties404" backend/code.gs` → 0 results ✓
- Management signature block present in lease document ✓
- Month-to-month end date shows "Month-to-Month — No Fixed Expiration" ✓
- `generateAndSendLease()` returns error when rent = 0 ✓

---

## Architecture Constraints (Read Before Every Phase)

1. **No Node.js, npm, or build tools** — pure static HTML/CSS/JS frontend only
2. **Backend is GAS only** — `backend/code.gs` is deployed externally to Google Apps Script
3. **No new infrastructure** — no databases, no new APIs, no new hosting layers
4. **Mobile-first CSS** — base styles target ≤ 480px; desktop via `min-width` breakpoints only
5. **Cloudflare Pages compatible** — frontend must remain a static deployment
6. **GAS constraints** — no ES modules, no `import/export`, use `var`/`const`/`let` GAS-compatible syntax
7. **Admin credentials** — NEVER hardcode in source; set manually via GAS editor Properties only
8. **`PROJECT_RULES.md`** — read before every phase; it is the non-negotiable architecture contract

---

  NEXT AI INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (this file) first
  - Read `PROJECT_RULES.md` second
  - Read `PHASE9_BUG_FIXES.md` third — this is the active work document
  - Phases 1–8 are complete. Phase 9 (Bug Fixes & Improvements) is STARTING.
  - A full deep scan was completed April 8, 2026 — all bugs are documented in `PHASE9_BUG_FIXES.md`
  - Fix in strict priority order: Phase 9A (critical) → 9B (important) → 9C (improvements)
  - Architecture constraints in `PROJECT_RULES.md` are non-negotiable — read before every change
  - Phase 7 (GAS Automation) is permanently cancelled — do NOT implement automated triggers
  - Do not introduce any infrastructure not already in the project

  ---

  ## Post-Phase Security Hardening (April 7, 2026)

  **Status:** COMPLETE

  Actions taken after all 8 phases completed:

  - [x] Redacted plaintext admin credentials from `AUDIT_REPORT.md`
  - [ ] Decommission dead Supabase Edge Functions (process-application, sign-lease, get-application-status, mark-paid, generate-lease, mark-movein, update-status) — no longer called by any page
  - [ ] Add rate limiting / honeypot to GAS `doPost()` endpoint

  ---

  ## Phase 9 — Bug Fixes & Integration Improvements

  **Status:** STARTING — April 8, 2026
  **Triggered by:** Deep scan of both repos (Apply_choice_properties + Choice)
  **Full detail:** See `PHASE9_BUG_FIXES.md` in this repo and `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` in the Choice repo

  ### Phase 9A — Critical (Fix First)
  - [ ] **9A-1** `updateStatus()` payment guard blocks denial of unpaid applicants (`backend/code.gs`)
  - [ ] **9A-2** Denial syncs `'active'` to Supabase — reverts rented property to available (`backend/code.gs`)
  - [ ] **9A-3** `p.monthly_rent.toLocaleString()` crashes property detail page on null rent (`Choice/property.html`)

  ### Phase 9B — Important (Fix After 9A)
  - [ ] **9B-1** Emergency Contact Phone field name mismatch — phone never normalized (`backend/code.gs`)
  - [ ] **9B-2** Date of Birth saved to localStorage — not excluded from auto-save (`js/script.js`)
  - [ ] **9B-3** Pets/smoking `"false"` string treated as truthy — policy flags misbehave (`js/script.js`, `Choice/property.html`)
  - [ ] **9B-4** Rent range filter silent failure when min > max — users see empty results with no explanation (`Choice/listings.html`)

  ### Phase 9C — Improvements (After bugs are fixed)
  - [ ] **9C-1** Application fee fully dynamic — remove `APPLICATION_FEE` hardcoded fallback; fee must always come from property data via URL param (`backend/code.gs`)
  - [ ] **9C-2** Add "Back to listing" link on application success screen (`js/script.js`, `index.html`)
  - [ ] **9C-3** Email-based App ID recovery on applicant dashboard login (`backend/code.gs`)
